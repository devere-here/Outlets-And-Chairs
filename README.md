#Outlets and Chairs

An app for people who study at cafes. This app tells you the location of all the cafes near your location and each cafe will have ratings based off of how good of a study spot it is. There are ratings for multiple categories such as access to chairs, outlets, and restrooms. These ratings are based off of user submissions after a user visits a cafe they can add their own rating and review.
